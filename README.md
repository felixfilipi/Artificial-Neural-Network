# Artificial-Neural-Network
This repository aims to **summarized** various projects that have been worked on during lectures, I hope all of you enjoy watching it and ***feel free*** to open issues when you see the wrong code. :wink:

The most common library to use here :
* Pandas 
* Numpy 
* Tensorflow 
* Matplotlib 
* sklearn

I used libraries in some specific version such as : 
* Python 3.7.9 
* Tensorflow 1.15.0
* Numpy 1.19.2
* Matplotlib 3.3.4
* scikit-learn 0.24.1

**Also I used Jupyter Notebook IDE so you will see most of my code have ipynb extension.**

**The project usually about classifying and forecasting.**
